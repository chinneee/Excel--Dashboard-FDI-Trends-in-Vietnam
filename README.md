# FDI Trends in Vietnam in the Period 2021-2022
## Context
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the economy of Vietnam and other countries worldwide. I've chosen 2021 and 2022 as comparison points to analyze how foreign direct investment (FDI) trends shifted from the height of the pandemic's effects to the period of reopening and resumption of trade. This comparison aims to uncover how FDI dynamics evolved as Vietnam transitioned from crisis management to economic recovery.
## Purpose of Analysis:

- To examine investment trends across provinces and industries in Vietnam.
- To gain a deeper understanding of the core factors driving these trends.
- To support the Ministry of Planning and Investment, along with the People's Committee, in assessing the current landscape and implementing effective policies to attract capital.
- To provide an accessible and visually engaging overview of Vietnam's FDI over the years.
